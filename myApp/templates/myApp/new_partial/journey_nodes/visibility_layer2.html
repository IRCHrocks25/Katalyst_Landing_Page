title: Layer 2: Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)
subtitle: Become the canonical answer. The source AI Overviews cite.
body: When Google shows an AI Overview or Alexa answers a question, they pull from sources they trust to be definitive. AEO structures your content so you're the answer, not just a result. Question-based content strategy. Featured snippet and AI Overview optimisation. Schema markup implementation. Concise, news-style answer formatting. Voice search optimisation. Result: Your brand becomes the answer Google and voice assistants surface when your market asks questions.
