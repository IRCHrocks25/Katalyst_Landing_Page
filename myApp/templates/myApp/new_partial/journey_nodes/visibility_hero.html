title: Dominate the Conversation Before It Even Starts.
subtitle: Rankings aren't enough anymore. In the zero-click era, the brands that win are the ones AI recommends.
body: 60% of searches now end without a click. Google's AI Overviews answer questions directly. Voice assistants give one answer. ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini are replacing traditional search. When someone asks an AI 'Who should I hire for X?' Katalyst ensures your brand is in that conversation.
