title: You're Paying for Fragmentation
body: Right now, your business runs on disconnected tools: a scheduling app here, a project manager there, a CRM that doesn't talk to your email, consultants who bill by the hour but disappear between calls. The result? You're the glue. Your time fills the gaps. Your brain holds the context. The AI Business Engine changes that. One intelligence layer that connects everything so you stop being the bottleneck.
